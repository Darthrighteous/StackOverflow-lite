I am coming from a place of winning all the time and I'm not sure what to do about this, I feel like I 'NEED' to celebrate. This doesn't feel normal to me. I don't want to celebrate because I want to, it feels more like society has programmed me to NEED to celebrate. Why can't I just go about my day normally?",
